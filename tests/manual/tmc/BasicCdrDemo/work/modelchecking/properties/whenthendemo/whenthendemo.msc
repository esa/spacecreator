/* Create Shared Condition Object/Objects based on desired configuration (see below)
    a) Shared Condition Object may have one of the following textual values :
        - "never"
        - "when"
        - "then"
        - "then not"
    b) One Shared Condition Object will cover all previously defined Instance Items
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 3 possible Shared Conditions Objects configuration
    - "never" - only one Shared Conditions Object should be created
        < Shared Condition Object "never">
        Signal Sequence
        
        Signal Sequence defined below Shared Condition Object "never" should not occur
        
    - "when"/"then" - two Shared Conditions Objects should be created (first "when" and second "then")
        < Shared Condition Object "when">
        Signal Sequence
        < Shared Condition Object "then">
        Signal Sequence
        
        If Signal Sequence defined below Shared Condition Object "when" occurs 
            then Signal Sequence defined below Shared Condition Object "then" should occur too
            
    - "when"/"then not" - two Shared Conditions Objects should be created (first "when" and second "then not")
        < Shared Condition Object "when">
        Signal Sequence
        < Shared Condition Object "then not">
        Signal Sequence
        
        If Signal Sequence defined below Shared Condition Object "when" occurs 
            then Signal Sequence defined below Shared Condition Object "then not" should not occur */
