# File IO

**1. Steps:**

* Open file `examples/interfaceview/allitems.xml`

Expected results:

* connections shouldn't overlap with any Function-like items they are not connected to
* Function and FunctionType items should not cover other items and should be bound within parent function geometry


**2. Steps:**

* Export file using interfaceviews.tmplt and save exported content
* Open previously saved file

Expected results:

* all items should have the same position/geometry as in previous check step


# Layout

**3. Steps:**

* Move or resize any item (Function, FunctionType, Comment) and release when it overlaps another item

Expected results:

* Item should restore it previous position/geometry


**4. Steps:**

* Move and resize any Function item and release when doesn't overlap another item

Expected results:

* Interfaces should be placed on the edges of changed item, without overlapping each other, connections (if any) should update layout without overlapping another items


**5. Steps:**

* Create Function-like item within any Function item

Expected results:

* Affected item should keep its geometry within parent Function item, and restore its previous state in case of overlapping with other items



# UndoStack

**6. Steps:**

* Perform Undo action

Expected results:

* Affected Item, its interfaces with linked connections should restore theirs previous geometry


**7. Steps:**

* Perform Redo action

Expected results:

* Affected item, its interfaces with linked connections should get new geometry
