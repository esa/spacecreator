## ASN1SCC requirements
Many features of the plugin depends on [ASN1SCC](https://github.com/ttsiodras/asn1scc) compiler. It is distributed along with the plugin itself. IDE can also be configured to use user-provided compiler version. ASN1SCC is F#/.NET based, so to run it system requires:
  * `fsharp` package on Linux
  * .NET Framework 4.6 on Windows (preinstalled in Windows 10 and newer)

# Installation
 1. Download plugin [release](https://github.com/n7space/asn1scc.IDE/releases) corresponding to installed Qt Creator version (plugin's version is based on compatible Qt Creator's version, so, for example, plugin 4.5.0 should work with QtCreator 4.5.1, but for Qt Creator 4.7.0 plugin 4.7.x is required)
 2. Unpack release package contents into Qt Creator installation directory. This directory is by default:
    * `/opt/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/` on Linux  
    * `C:\Qt\Tools\QtCreator` on Windows   
 3. Run Qt Creator - plugin should be available on plugins list in *Help > About Plugins...* ![Screen-About](images/screen-about.png)
