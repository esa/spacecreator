  \brief ive::ZOrder

  This static anonymous struct holds values for items Z ordering:
    \var Topmost
        Maximum available Z level.
    \var Selected
        The Z level for a selected item; When selected, the item is raised to be almost-the-topmost (Topmost-1),
        so a Connection overlapped by a Comment is visible.
    \var Preview
        The alias for Topmost Z level. Used for preview an item during its creation, so it does not go under
  existent/selected items.

    \var Function
        Z level of IVFunctionGraphicsItem and IVFunctionTypeGraphicsItem.
    \var Connection
        Z level of IVConnectionGraphicsItem.
    \var Interface
        Z level of IVInterfaceGraphicsItem.
    \var Comment
        Z level of IVCommentGraphicsItem.
    \var GripPoint
        Z level of GripPoint item â€” alias for Selected (almost-the-topmost).
