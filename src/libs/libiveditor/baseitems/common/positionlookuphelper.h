   \class ive::PositionLookupHelper
   \brief Class to find free place

    Class is used to find the place for \a itemRect
    keeping \a originPoint on the edge of on \a parentRect
    avoiding colliding with \a siblingsRects moving \a clockwise
    according to value set

    \arg \c sidePaths are possible shapes (geometries) for parent rect sides
    \arg \c parentRect is the geometry where \a itemRect should be placed aligned
    \arg \c siblingsRects are other rects to avoid colliding with
    \arg \c itemRect is the initial value of rect should be aligned
    \arg \c originPoint is the initial origin point position
    \arg \c clockwise moving if \a true otherwise counterclockwise
