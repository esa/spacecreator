/**
 * @brief The ExportableProperty class is needed for string templates only.
 * It seems Grantlee doesn't fully support Django syntax like
 * @code
 *  {% for key, value in iface.properties %}
 *      <Property name="{{ key }}" value="{{ value }}"/>
 *  {% endfor %}
 * @endcode
 * Therefore IVObject has a property "properties" and "attributes"
 * which are lists of ExportableProperty
 * and thus it's possible to write like this:
 * @code
 *  {% for property in iface.properties %}
 *      <Property name="{{ property.name }}" value="{{ property.value }}"/>
 *  {% endfor %}
 * @endcode
